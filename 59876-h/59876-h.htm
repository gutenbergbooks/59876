<small>THE TREE-DWELLER CHILDREN</small></h2></div>


<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_002.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Rago and Goni were brother
and sister.</p>



<p>They lived a long time ago in a
country far, far away.</p>

<p>They were the first little boy
and girl that we know anything
about.</p>

<p>Rago and Goni lived among the
tall trees on the wooded hill near
the river.</p>

<p>They lived with their mother
and baby sister.</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_003.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>Rago was twelve years old and
Goni was seven.</p>

<p>Baby sister was much younger.
She was too little
to take care of
herself.</p>



<p>Mother always
carried her little
girl with her.</p>

<p>Of course she
could not carry
her baby in her
arms, for she
needed her hands for other things.</p>

<p>Sometimes the baby clung to a
strong vine which her mother tied
around her waist.</p>

<p>Sometimes she just held fast to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
her mother&#8217;s waist or clung to her
neck.</p>

<p>One morning very early Rago
awakened with
a start.</p>

<p>He sat up and
listened.</p>

<p>He had been
fast asleep in
the branches of
the strong oak
tree.</p>



<p>Rago and
Goni always
slept in trees.</p>

<p>Really the trees were the only
home Rago and Goni knew.</p>

<p>That night their mother had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
selected beds in the oak trees, because
the strong branches were
woven together with vines.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_004.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>These vines made good strong
beds for the children.</p>

<p>Sometimes when there were no
vines, the Tree-dwellers wove the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
slender branches of the tall trees
together.</p>

<p>This also made a strong bed to
lie upon.</p>

<p>Very often the older Tree dwellers
would just stretch themselves
on a strong branch for the night.</p>

<p>They would tie themselves to
the branch to keep from falling.</p>

<p>Rago had been sleeping so
soundly that he had to rub his
eyes to make himself wake up.</p>

<p>Then he looked down toward
the foot of the tree.</p>

<p>There stood two huge panthers.</p>

<p>Rago was afraid, for he knew
that the panthers could climb
trees quickly and easily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>&#8220;What shall I do, what shall I
do?&#8221; he thought.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_006.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>He was almost afraid to move
for fear the panthers would rush
right up the tree.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>Just then he heard his mother
call softly from a nearby tree.</p>

<p>She too had seen the panthers.</p>

<p>She had already picked up her
baby and put her upon her back.</p>

<p>The baby clung fast to her
mother&#8217;s neck. She was frightened,
for she had been awakened
from a sound sleep.</p>

<p>Goni was still fast asleep, she
had not heard the fierce cry of the
panthers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waken your sister, Rago,&#8221;
called his mother, &#8220;she is fast
asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, mother,&#8221; he answered
softly.</p>

<p>Rago sprang lightly from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
branch to the other until he
reached the oak tree in which
Goni slept.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_008.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>He had to be very quiet so the
panthers would not hear him.</p>

<p>Not a sound did he make so
lightly did he go, and soon he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
reached the tree in which Goni
slept.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up, Goni, wake up, Goni,&#8221;
whispered Rago. &#8220;The panthers
are at the foot of these trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Goni sat up and began to cry.
She was very frightened. &#8220;Hush,
hush, sister,&#8221; whispered Rago,
&#8220;the panthers will hear you.
Come, we must go to another
part of the forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is mother?&#8221; cried Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is coming with baby sister,&#8221;
whispered Rago. &#8220;Hurry,
spring lightly, so the panthers
will not hear you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rago and Goni did not stop to
dress, for they wore no clothing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Very nimbly they sprang from
branch to branch and soon they
reached another part of the forest.</p>

<p>Their mother followed them
with baby sister upon her back.</p>

<p>Soon they stopped to rest and
listen.</p>

<p>The panthers had not heard
them go, so softly did they move.</p>

<p>They were afraid the panthers
might follow them, but when they
stopped to look they were not in
sight.</p>

<p>How glad they were to be safe!</p>

<p>&#8220;The panthers were very near
us that time,&#8221; said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well we heard them before
they reached us,&#8221; said mother.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE RACE</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;Help me weave the slender
branches of this cedar tree together,
Rago,&#8221; said his mother.
&#8220;Then I can put baby upon
them and we can find something
to eat for breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am very hungry and
thirsty,&#8221; said Goni.</p>

<p>So Rago and his mother worked
quickly and soon had a fine
strong bed woven.</p>

<p>Then mother laid baby sister
upon it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>&#8220;Let us look to see that there
are no tigers nor lions below,&#8221;
said their mother. &#8220;It would
not be safe to climb down if there
were.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked carefully in all directions.</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; said Goni, &#8220;there are
some wild horses, eating on the
grassy plain beyond the forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See that huge cave bear
just going into his cave,&#8221; cried
Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;He certainly does look fierce,&#8221;
said Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he will sleep all day,&#8221;
said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us climb down,&#8221; said Goni.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said Rago, &#8220;I am
ready.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Do not go far, children,&#8221; said
their mother, &#8220;for it is still very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
early and there are wild beasts
about.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_014.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p>&#8220;I must stay near by, to watch
baby sister.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>&#8220;All right, mother,&#8221; said the
children as they climbed down the
tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go to the river for a
drink of cool water,&#8221; said Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; said Rago, &#8220;but
be careful and look sharply.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the brother and sister ran
along very swiftly toward the river.</p>

<p>Suddenly they stopped. &#8220;I
hear sounds,&#8221; whispered Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Goni! Where do the
sounds come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem to come from the
thicket close by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quickly, Goni, climb this tree!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See that pack of hyenas! They
are stealing down to their cave.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>&#8220;How their cowardly eyes
gleam!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well you heard them in the
thicket, Rago,&#8221; said Goni.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_016.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if my ears and eyes
will ever be as sharp as yours, so
that I may know when the wild
beasts are near?&#8221; said Goni.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Rago, &#8220;when
you are a little older you will hear
sounds just as I do, Goni.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us run a race to the river
in the trees,&#8221; said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready, go!&#8221; and the brother
and sister swung lightly from
branch to branch until they
reached the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry, Goni, hurry or I shall
get there first,&#8221; called Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming, Rago,&#8221; answered
Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will wait for you, Goni,&#8221;
called Rago as he reached the river
first.</p>

<p>They waited and listened a
moment in the trees, then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
dropped lightly to the ground and
ran to the water&#8217;s edge.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Quickly they dipped up the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
with their hands and drank all
they wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let us go back to mother
and baby sister,&#8221; said Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can gather some nuts and
berries on the way,&#8221; said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us take the trail back.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the brother and sister started
back. They listened and
looked as they ran.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THEIR FOOD</small></h2></div>


<p>On their way back Rago and
Goni stopped to eat berries and
roots for their breakfast.</p>

<p>They were hungry, so they ate
heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;See! here are some acorns,
Goni,&#8221; called Rago. &#8220;Would you
like some of these to eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; answered Goni, and
she ran to where Rago was standing.</p>

<p>The children cracked the acorns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
with their strong, sharp teeth, and
ate the kernels quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us carry some nuts back
to mother,&#8221; said Goni.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_021.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>&#8220;She can not go far from baby
sister.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Rago, &#8220;and here
are some blueberries which mother
will like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How shall we carry them?&#8221;
asked Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had a rabbit&#8217;s skin we
might carry the acorns in that,&#8221;
said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rabbits&#8217; skins make fine baskets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You carry these branches with
the berries on them, Goni, and I
will carry the nuts in my hands,&#8221;
said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we should have to climb a
tree suddenly, we can drop the
nuts and berries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let us hurry back, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
mother will wonder if we are
safe,&#8221; said Rago.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_023.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>As they neared the place where
their mother was, they shouted,
&#8220;Mother! Mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I am,&#8221; answered their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
mother, who was sitting on a
branch in a tall tree.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_024.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Baby and I have been waiting
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time baby sister was
wide awake and her mother was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
singing to her as she held her in
her arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, mother,&#8221; said the children,
&#8220;here are some berries and
acorns for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rago had to climb the tree to
hand the nuts and berries to his
mother.</p>

<p>He had to climb with one hand,
his other hand was full of nuts and
he carried the branches under his
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, children,&#8221; said
their mother, &#8220;I am glad to have
the berries and nuts, for I have
had no breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baby sister smiled too, for she
wanted breakfast also.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>&#8220;Here are some nuts I cannot
crack,&#8221; said their mother. &#8220;Will
you crack them for me?&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_026.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Rago and he tried
to crack the nuts with his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have to try a stone,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
said Rago, &#8220;for I cannot crack
them with my teeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>He climbed down the tree and
soon found a stone. The rough
edges hurt his hands, so he wound
one end with grass.</p>

<p>This made a fine hammer and
the nuts were soon cracked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, mother, are the nuts,&#8221;
called Rago. &#8220;Are you coming
down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered his mother as
she sprang nimbly from the tree.
&#8220;Thank you, Rago, that is a
fine way to crack nuts when our
teeth cannot crack them. Now
I shall take baby sister to the
river for a drink.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE ANIMALS</small></h2></div>


<p>While their mother went to the
river to get baby sister a drink
of water, the brother and sister
played among the trees.</p>

<p>As they ran to and fro they
stopped to listen to the call of the
birds and to watch the squirrels
as they frisked about.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that, Rago?&#8221; said
Goni, pointing to something very
near.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are wild hogs,&#8221; said Rago.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>&#8220;See how the young ones gather
close to their mother.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_029.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;They are afraid to leave
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Their mother is digging into
the earth among the roots of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
tree. She is looking for food for
her children,&#8221; said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what those black
things are that they are digging
for,&#8221; said Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we see?&#8221; asked Rago, as
he picked up his club and threw
it toward the wild hogs.</p>

<p>This frightened them and they
dashed away, the young pigs following
their mother to the underbrush
not far away.</p>

<p>When they had gone, Rago and
Goni ran to the place where the
mother hog had been digging.</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; said Rago, &#8220;they were
digging for truffles. Here is one,
Goni, eat it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>Goni bit into the rough black
truffle with her sharp teeth.</p>

<p>It was white inside. &#8220;I like it,&#8221;
said Goni, as she ate the truffle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never eaten a truffle before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Goni!&#8221; cried Rago, &#8220;I
think there must be a bee&#8217;s nest
in that hollow stump.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like some honey,&#8221;
said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the bees might sting you,&#8221;
said Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t mind a bee&#8217;s sting,&#8221;
answered Rago.</p>

<p>So Rago went toward the hollow
stump. He looked in. It
was filled with sweet wild honey.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Rago put in his hand and filled
it with the honey.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_032.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The bees didn&#8217;t like their nest
being robbed.</p>

<p>They buzzed about Rago and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
stung him badly, but he didn&#8217;t
care because he was used to being
hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goni, come and eat some
honey,&#8221; called Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Rago, I am afraid of
the bees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then stay where you are and I
will bring you some,&#8221; called Rago.</p>

<p>So Rago filled his hand again
with honey and ran with it to
Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Rago,&#8221; said Goni,
&#8220;I wish I were as brave as you
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day you will be,&#8221; said
Rago. &#8220;You are not as old as
I am, Goni.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>&#8220;Come, let us go back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rago picked up his club, because
he felt safer when he carried
it.</p>

<p>The brother and sister started
back.</p>

<p>As they ran along they shouted,
&#8220;Mother, we are coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly they stopped. &#8220;Hush!&#8221;
said Rago, as a little rabbit scampered
across their path.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall catch that rabbit for
dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us be very quiet, Goni,
and it will come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, crouch down so that
the rabbit will think we are logs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now watch,&#8221; whispered Rago.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Soon the little rabbit scampered
out of its hiding place.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_035.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Rago crept up quietly behind
it.</p>

<p>Then he raised his club and with
one sharp blow the little rabbit
was dead.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>&#8220;See, Goni!&#8221; said Rago, holding
up the rabbit, &#8220;won&#8217;t we have
a fine dinner!&#8221;</p>

<small>THE HUNT</small></h2></div>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_037.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;See, mother, what a fine rabbit
I have
caught,&#8221; cried
Rago as he
ran up to his
mother.</p>



<p>Rago sat
down on the
ground and
began to skin
the little rabbit
with his
sharp stone knife.</p>



<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_038.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>He had made this knife himself
from a smooth pebble by clipping
off flakes from one end, until it
had a sharp point.</p>

<p>He left one end smooth so that
it would not hurt his hand.</p>

<p>Then he had a splendid sharp
knife which
he could use
for many
things.</p>



<p>When he
had skinned
the rabbit he
laid the skin
on the ground
to dry.</p>

<p>Then the sister and brother ate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the rabbit&#8217;s flesh, which Rago cut
into strips.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is good,&#8221; said Goni, as
she ate the raw flesh.</p>

<p>Rago cracked the bones with
his stone hammer and sucked the
marrow from them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a fine bone for you,
Goni,&#8221; said Rago. &#8220;You can crack
it with your teeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly Rago jumped to his
feet. &#8220;What do I hear?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, get into this fir tree
quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were just in time, for a
huge rhinoceros came to the very
spot where the children had been
sitting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>He went along slowly.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_040.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;I am glad we aren&#8217;t down
there,&#8221; said Rago.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>&#8220;The beast would have crushed
us if we had been sitting there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure he can&#8217;t see us up
here,&#8221; said their mother, &#8220;for the
rhinoceros cannot see very far
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he a very fierce creature?&#8221;
asked Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; answered Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;No animal likes to meet the
rhinoceros, he is so fierce and
huge.</p>

<p>&#8220;He uses his tusked snout to
strike with.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even the mammoth and fierce
sabretooth fear him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be very angry at
something.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>&#8220;Watch him tear down that
tall cedar tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can hear him grind the
wood with his strong teeth.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_042.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what he is so angry
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they were watching the huge
creature, they saw a man running
in the distance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>He was running toward the
spot where the huge rhinoceros
stood.</p>

<p>The man had a torch in his
hand, and waved it as he ran.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_043.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Back of him were other men all
running toward the rhinoceros.</p>

<p>They all carried burning
torches.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&#8220;Who are these strange men?&#8221;
asked Rago. &#8220;They are following
the rhinoceros.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that is why he is so
angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are the Tree-dwellers who
belong to the clan that lives some
distance away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does the leader wear
skins over his shoulder?&#8221; asked
Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;This shows that he is very
brave,&#8221; answered their mother,
&#8220;because he must first kill the
wild animals, before he can wear
their skins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See, he has feathers in his hair
and a necklace about his neck.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said their mother, &#8220;this
necklace is made from the teeth of
wild beasts.</p>

<p>&#8220;These Tree-dwellers wear teeth
strung on sinews about their necks,
and arms and ankles.</p>

<p>&#8220;This shows that they have
killed many wild beasts, and they
are very proud to wear their
teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;The more necklaces and feathers
and skins they have the braver
they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See how near the leader goes to
the rhinoceros,&#8221; shouted Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;All of the other men are following
him, waving their firebrands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are driving him toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the steep cliff. Now he has almost
reached the edge,&#8221; cried Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will surely fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the huge rhinoceros
lost his footing and fell over the
steep cliff.</p>

<p>Then the leader with some of
the men climbed down the cliff.</p>

<p>They knew that the beast was
dead, and they wished to take
back trophies to show their clan
how brave they had been.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our people will praise us,&#8221;
said the leader, &#8220;when we take
these trophies back with us.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE CLAN</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;Mother, why can&#8217;t we live with
those Tree-dwellers?&#8221; asked Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go down and wait for
the men. Maybe they will take
us with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they would,&#8221; answered
their mother, &#8220;they are always
ready to make their clan larger.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they got down from the trees
and squatted upon the ground.</p>

<p>As they sat there, they watched
a herd of wild cattle coming slowly
along.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>They were wandering toward
the river for a drink of cool
water.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, they have a leader,&#8221; said
Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Rago, &#8220;cattle always
follow their leader.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will have to watch out
for the wolves and bears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The other day I saw a pack of
wolves rush upon a herd of cattle,&#8221;
said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;They seized three young cattle
and killed them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wolves are always ready for
a feast,&#8221; said their mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I hear the men coming
back,&#8221; said Rago.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>&#8220;They are going back by the
trail. Let us call to them. They
will hear us.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_049.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>So Rago shouted very loudly.
He shouted again and again.</p>

<p>The leader of the men heard the
call.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear someone calling,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
said. &#8220;Let us go into the forest
and see who it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>So all of the men went into the
forest and soon came upon Rago
and Goni, who were sitting on the
ground, with their mother and
baby sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you call?&#8221; asked the leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered their mother.
&#8220;Will you take us with you?</p>

<p>&#8220;We should like to join your
clan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the leader, &#8220;we shall
be glad to have you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we have someone to play
with?&#8221; asked Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there are many boys and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
girls in our clan,&#8221; answered the
leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very brave,&#8221; said
Rago. &#8220;I watched you drive the
huge rhinoceros to the edge of the
cliff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to be as brave as
you are when I am a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will teach you how to be
brave,&#8221; said the leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let us start as it is getting
late.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they all started off together.</p>

<p>Rago and Goni weren&#8217;t a bit
afraid because they were with these
brave men.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; asked Rago,
pointing to the firebrand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>&#8220;This is a fire-torch,&#8221; said the
leader; &#8220;when we carry these we
need not be afraid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire protects us from the wild
beast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where do you get fire?&#8221;
asked Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so very long ago we had a
terrible storm in our forest. It
thundered and lightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lightning set fire to the
trees in the forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;At first we Tree-dwellers
thought that the fire was a terrible
monster. We were frightened
and ran away from it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we learned that the fire
would not harm us and that if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
fed it wood, it would burn on forever.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we have fire there is no
need for swinging from tree to tree,
for we are safe on the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do the wild beasts fear the
firebrands?&#8221; asked Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I use a firebrand?&#8221; asked
Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the leader.
&#8220;You may light your own firebrand,
and you may help us feed
the fire also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad we are going to live
with you,&#8221; said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be glad to have you,&#8221;
said the leader.</p>

<small>THE FIRE</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;I am tired and hungry,&#8221; said
Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the leader,
&#8220;let us look for food.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are plenty of roots and
nuts around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here are some acorns, Goni;
eat them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rago found his own food as did
all of the men.</p>

<p>After they had eaten all they
wished they started off again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>&#8220;The trees might be safer,&#8221; said
the leader, &#8220;for our torches have
gone out and it is getting late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can already hear the growls
of the cave bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have been asleep all day
and are looking for a feast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All for the trees!&#8221; shouted the
leader.</p>

<p>So they all climbed the trees and
nimbly swung from branch to
branch.</p>

<p>&#8220;That largest horse is leading
the herd up the trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if there are any wild
beasts lying in wait for them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do the horses go at
night?&#8221; asked Goni.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>&#8220;To the grassy plain outside
the forest,&#8221; answered the leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have to eat the green
grass which they find there.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_057.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; said the leader,
as all of the men suddenly jumped
to the ground.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>There were many Tree-dwellers
squatting around the fire.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_059.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>One strong Tree-dweller woman
was feeding the fire with huge cedar
logs.</p>

<p>Some of the young boys were
playing that a cave bear had come
suddenly upon them.</p>



<p>They had make-believe torches
with which they were pretending
to frighten the fierce bear.</p>

<p>They all stopped and looked at
Rago and Goni and their mother,
who had baby sister in her
arms.</p>

<p>Baby sister began to cry when
she saw so many people.</p>

<p>Goni clutched Rago&#8217;s arm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>&#8220;I am afraid, Rago,&#8221; said Goni.</p>

<p>Rago was frightened also. He
didn&#8217;t go very near the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not be afraid,&#8221; said
the leader. &#8220;The fire is our friend.
It will not hurt you.&#8221;</p>



<p>The children ran
toward Rago and
Goni and pushed
them toward the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not hurt
you,&#8221; they cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will keep you warm, and
protect you from the wild beasts.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, here is some roasted squirrel&#8217;s
meat which you may have.</p>

<p>&#8220;Taste it and see how good it
is.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>Rago had never eaten roasted
meat before.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is good,&#8221; said Rago. &#8220;I have
never eaten roasted meat before.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_060.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;How did you learn that meat
could be roasted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One day, Strong-arm, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
leader of our clan, threw down a
squirrel near the fire. It was so
near that the fire scorched it.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Strong-arm ate the
squirrel&#8217;s meat it tasted so good
that he told the other people in
the clan about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since then we often roast our
meat because we like it better
than raw meat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like roasted meat,
mother?&#8221; asked Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a piece of meat for you,
baby sister,&#8221; said Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, sit down with us,&#8221; said
the children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strong-arm has something to
show us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>Strong-arm was sitting near the
fire with the other Tree-dwellers
about him.</p>

<p>He was telling them all about
the hunt that day.</p>

<p>He told them how the huge
rhinoceros had fallen over the cliff.</p>

<p>He showed them the tusks, and
teeth and claws.</p>

<p>The Tree-dwellers were all very
much pleased, and they praised
the men for their bravery.</p>

<p>When he had finished talking,
Strong-arm jumped up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us all play the hunt of
today,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You be the leader, Strong-arm,&#8221;
they shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Strong-arm;
&#8220;let us pretend that the huge
rhinoceros is here and we will
show you just what we did.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_063.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>So the men played the hunt.</p>

<p>They acted just as if it were real.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is our hunting dance,&#8221;
said one of the children to Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a hunting dance every
night after the men return from
the hunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;These make us brave and teach
us how to hunt together.</p>

<p>&#8220;They teach all of the people
how to do their part.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day we shall be brave
enough to take part in a real
hunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope to be brave enough to
be a leader,&#8221; said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the other child, &#8220;I
do too.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE SHELTER</small></h2></div>


<p>It was growing late and the
Tree-dwellers were tired.</p>

<p>So they stretched themselves
about the fire to sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall watch the fire tonight,&#8221;
said one of the women.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why must someone watch the
fire?&#8221; asked Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not let it go out,&#8221;
answered Strong-arm, &#8220;for if we
did we would have no fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish to sleep on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
ground,&#8221; said Goni. &#8220;I am
afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may sleep in the trees if
you wish,&#8221; said Strong-arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where will you sleep, Rago?&#8221;
asked Strong-arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall sleep on the ground,&#8221;
answered Rago. &#8220;I am not
afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>So their mother found a bed in
the evergreen trees for Goni and
baby sister.</p>

<p>She, too, stretched herself on a
limb and tied herself tightly to it
so she would not fall.</p>

<p>There she could watch baby
sister and Goni.</p>

<p>She could look down on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Tree-dwellers as they slept on the
ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_067.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The trees sheltered them from
the wind and rain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>So they slept through the long
night.</p>

<p>All night long the woman Tree-dweller
fed the fire. She did not
sleep for fear the fire would go
out.</p>

<p>In the early morning the Tree-dwellers
awoke.</p>

<p>Each one left the fireplace to go
in search of food.</p>

<p>The mothers carried their babies
with them, and did not go
far away from the fire.</p>

<p>The men went into the forest.</p>

<p>They left a woman in charge of
the fire.</p>

<p>When Goni and baby sister
awoke, Rago had already eaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
his breakfast of berries and roots,
which he found near by.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_069.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>He stood watching some women
who were working among the evergreen
trees.</p>

<p>He wondered what they were
doing, as he watched them break
off the evergreen branches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I help you carry them?&#8221;
asked Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the woman.
&#8220;You may carry the branches to
those young trees near the fire.
We shall follow you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rago wondered what the women
would do with the branches.</p>

<p>They soon came carrying armfuls
of them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>Rago watched them bend down
the tops of the young trees and
tie them together.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_071.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>They wove the evergreens
among them and piled larger
branches against the young trees
to strengthen them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&#8220;What are you making?&#8221; asked
Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;A shelter for our children,
which will protect them from the
cold and rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that it is cold and the
trees have lost their leaves we need
shelter for our children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not these evergreen trees
protect you from the rain and
snow?&#8221; asked Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not always,&#8221; answered the
woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have carried our fire to the
evergreen trees, because they are
the only trees which will protect
us in the winter.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the needles of the evergreen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
trees do not protect us so
well as the leaves of the birch and
oak trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never seen a shelter before,&#8221;
said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the woman, &#8220;this is
the first house which the Tree-dwellers
have made.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rago went to the fire. The Tree-dweller
woman was piling cedar
logs upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are all of the men?&#8221;
asked Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have gone into the forest
to hunt,&#8221; answered the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Rago,&#8221; called one of
the boys, &#8220;let us go into the forest
too.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; asked
Rago of the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Long-head,&#8221; said
the boy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_074.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;How old are you, Long-head?&#8221;
asked Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am fourteen years old,&#8221; answered
Long-head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8220;I am twelve,&#8221; said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; said Long-head,
&#8220;here is a firebrand for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rago felt very big with the firebrand
in his hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_075.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>He wasn&#8217;t afraid to carry it.</p>

<p>Now he would not have to
swing from branch to branch, but
could walk upon the ground. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
would be safe while he carried the
torch.</p>

<p>The two boys wandered into the
forest.</p>

<p>At first they followed the trail,
then they left the trail and went
into the denser part of the forest.</p>

<p>Long-head walked faster than
Rago and soon got ahead.</p>

<p>Rago did not hurry, for he had
many strange things to look at.</p>

<p>He was used to traveling in the
trees, for he had never before had
a torch to protect him.</p>

<p>He felt very brave and safe as
he walked along.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>THE ATTACK</small></h2></div>


<p>Suddenly he stopped, for he
heard a loud call.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help! help!&#8221; came from the
distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming,&#8221; shouted Rago,
&#8220;I&#8217;m coming,&#8221; and he ran in the
direction of the call.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help! help!&#8221; came the call
again, and this time Rago knew
that it was Long-head calling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming, I&#8217;m coming,&#8221;
shouted Rago as he ran on as fast
as he could.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
It was not very easy running,
for the trees were very thick in
this part of the forest.</p>

<p>As he neared the spot from
which the sound had come, he
heard a fierce growl.</p>

<p>Growl after growl he heard.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis a wolf, &#8217;tis a wolf,&#8221; he
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your torch, Long-head?&#8221;
panted Rago, as he came
up out of breath.</p>

<p>He saw Long-head standing
against the tree, and the wolf
ready to spring upon him.</p>

<p>Long-head was terribly frightened,
for he could not defend himself
against the wolf.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>His torch was out, and he had
lost his club. He didn&#8217;t dare attempt
to climb the tree for fear the
wolf would seize him.</p>

<p>Rago came up cautiously from
behind. With one bound he waved
his torch before the eyes of the
wolf.</p>

<p>The fire terrified the wolf and
he made one leap for the thicket.</p>

<p>Then Long-head sank to the
ground. He was weak with fright.</p>

<p>&#8220;He almost had me, that
time,&#8221; said Long-head.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was upon me before I
knew it. My torch had gone
out and I was waiting for you,
when the wolf sprang toward me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>&#8220;He must have come from the
thicket, because I didn&#8217;t see him
until he was upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That certainly was a narrow
escape,&#8221; said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad I heard you call.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must stay together now;
my torch will protect both of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us find something to eat,&#8221;
said Long-head.</p>

<p>So they walked on through the
forest. They found nuts and
roots and fruits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out,&#8221; said Long-head,
pointing to an opening in the hillside.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the home of the cave
bear. Don&#8217;t go too near.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>&#8220;The cave bears are asleep,
aren&#8217;t they?&#8221; asked Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but they may wake up,&#8221;
answered Long-head.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_082.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t care to be attacked
by a cave bear,&#8221; said Long-head.
&#8220;They certainly are fierce creatures.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>&#8220;What a fine patch of blueberries!&#8221;
said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goni and baby sister would
like some of these berries, I know.
I wish I might carry some to
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will show you how to make a
basket,&#8221; said Long-head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us find some rushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a marshy place,&#8221; said
Long-head, pointing to the river.
&#8220;We can find some rushes there.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the boys gathered the rushes
and sat down upon the ground to
make the basket.</p>

<p>Long-head wove the rushes together
for the bottom of the
basket.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>When he had tied the ends together
at the top, he wove around
the sides, until the basket was
deep enough. Then he fastened
the rushes tightly, so that the basket
would be strong enough to
hold the berries.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_084.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>&#8220;What a fine basket,&#8221; said Rago.
&#8220;I have never seen a rush
basket before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let me try to make one.&#8221;
Then Rago wove a basket like
the one which Long-head had
made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother will be pleased to see
my basket,&#8221; said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the blueberry patch.
We can fill our baskets.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two boys picked enough
berries to fill their baskets.</p>

<p>&#8220;These baskets are very
strong,&#8221; said Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Long-head. &#8220;Oak
leaves make strong baskets, also.&#8221;</p>

<p>After they had filled their baskets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the boys wandered about for
a while.</p>

<p>They watched the cattle going
toward the stream for their evening&#8217;s
drink.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_086.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Let us follow them,&#8221; said
Long-head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>They enjoyed seeing the cattle
wade knee-deep into the stream
and drink of the clear, cool water.</p>

<p>Both Rago and Long-head dipped
their hands into the water.
They filled them and drank.</p>

<p>They were thirsty, for they had
had no water all day.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis growing late,&#8221; said Long-head.
&#8220;See, the sun is setting.</p>

<p>&#8220;The men will be coming back
to the fire. Let us go back also.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have to tell them
about the fierce wolf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will they play it?&#8221; asked
Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; answered Long-head.</p>

<small>THE RETURN</small></h2></div>


<p>When Rago and Long-head
reached the fire, the men had already
returned.</p>

<p>They were sitting on the ground
about the fire.</p>

<p>Rago ran up to Goni, saying,
&#8220;Here are some fine blueberries,
Goni. I thought you would like
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get the basket,
Rago?&#8221; asked Goni.</p>

<p>&#8220;I made it from rushes,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Rago. &#8220;Long-head showed me
how to make it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day I will show you how
to make a basket just like this
one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is baby sister?&#8221; asked
Rago.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is in there,&#8221; said Goni,
pointing to the shelter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind is so cold that the
children are in there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rago walked over toward Long-head.
He was talking to the men
in a very excited way.</p>

<p>Rago knew he was telling them
of his narrow escape from the wolf.</p>

<p>The men were listening and asking
questions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>&#8220;You must be more careful in
the future, Long-head,&#8221; they said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a brave boy, Rago,&#8221;
said Strong-arm. &#8220;We are glad
you have come to live with us.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_090.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>This pleased Rago very much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us play it,&#8221; said the men.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>So they pretended that one man
was the fierce wolf, and another
played that he was Rago.</p>

<p>Then the man who played that
he was Rago rushed upon the
wolf, waving his torch in his
eyes.</p>

<p>The Tree-dwellers were very
much interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let us play it,&#8221; said one
of the older boys.</p>

<p>So the boys had their hunting
dance. They were glad to play
what the men had played.</p>

<p>After the hunting dance the
men told about the animals which
they had seen that day.</p>

<p>They pretended that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
animals and showed just how the
animals acted.</p>

<p>Strong-arm held up the skin of
a gopher which he had killed.</p>

<p>He told how the gophers lived
among the tall grass, and how
quick one had to be to catch them.</p>

<p>Strong-arm showed the other
Tree-dwellers how he had caught
this gopher.</p>

<p>Another man told how he had
chased a cave bear back to its den
with his torch. He showed just
how he had done this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, the fire is our friend,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;for I could not have
frightened the cave bear without
a torch.&#8221;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
